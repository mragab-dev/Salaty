## üìÅ Project Structure

The codebase is organized into logical directories to maintain clarity and scalability:

-   **`assets/`**: Contains all static assets like fonts, images, sounds, and data files (Quran, Adhkar, etc.).
-   **`components/`**: Reusable UI components used across different screens (e.g., `PrayerCard`, `QiblaCompass`, `Modal`).
-   **`constants/`**: Holds constant values used throughout the app, such as API endpoints, color palettes, and AsyncStorage keys.
-   **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks (e.g., `useGeolocation`).
-   **`screens/`**: Main screen components, each representing a full view in the app (e.g., `PrayerTimesScreen`, `QuranIndexScreen`).
-   **`services/`**: Contains business logic, API interactions, and service modules (e.g., `prayerTimeService`, `notificationService`, `quranAudioService`).
-   **`types.ts`**: TypeScript type definitions for the entire application.
-   **`App.tsx`**: The root component of the application, handling navigation and global setup.
